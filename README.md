## About
This analysis uses data from [Citi Bike Data]([https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data)). I took the data from January, April, July and October of 2022 and cleansed the data in Jupyter Notebook, utilizing Pandas and Math. The code to calulate the distance between the Start and End stations was copied from [this stack overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27928/calculate-distance-between-two-latitude-longitude-points-haversine-formula). This is also noted in the code. The data was visualised and analysis performed in Tableau Public, and a final story was set up and published.
